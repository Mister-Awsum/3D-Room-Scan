3D Room Scanner!

Project Overview:
This repository contains the source code and relevant documentation for the 3D Room Scanner, a project focused on recreated a physical space in a 3D representation. The project involves various technologies [Texas Instruments' Microcontroller, Embedded C, Keil uVision and Python's Pyserial and Open3D features] and implements a ToF sensor into an embedded System for capturing data about the world around the scanner.

Repository Structure:
Project Info/ – Contains detailed documentation about the project, including design decisions, methodology, and implementation details.
Data/ – Stores all generated output files and processed data.
Source Code/ – Includes the main codebase for the project.
README.md – This file, providing an overview of the project.

Getting Started:
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1) Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Mister-Awsum/3D-Room-Scan/tree/main

2) Navigate to the project directory
cd 3D-Room-Scan

3) Refer to the Project Info folder for additional details on setup, usage, and implementation.

Technologies Used:
C - Used for instructing the Microcontroller on operating stepper motor.
Python - Used for visualization of data gathered from ToF Sensor.
Pyserial - Used for collecting data from ToF Sensor to laptop or computer.
Open3D - Used for plotting of ToF Sensor results in 3D space.
